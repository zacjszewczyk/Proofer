<h2>Basic Computer Security</h2>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 80. Sentences: 5</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>The Internet ranks among the greatest <span class='complex_word'>inventions</span> of all time. It gives <span class='complex_word'>everyone</span> instant access to mankind&#8217;s <span class='complex_word'>collective</span> wisdom, learned through millions of years of <span class='complex_word'>evolution</span>. It connects people across cultures, <span class='complex_word'>continents</span>, and time zones. It ushered in an era of <span class='complex_word'>unprecedented</span> <span class='complex_word'>economic</span> growth. History <span class='complex_word'>already</span> <span class='complex_word'>recognizes</span> the Internet&#8217;s <span class='complex_word'>remarkable</span> impact, in the few short decades it has <span class='complex_word'>existed</span> so far, and its <span class='complex_word'>significance</span> will continue to grow as mankind uses it to achieve even greater things down the road.</p>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 137. Sentences: 7</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>Despite its immense value, today the Internet kind of sucks. The part of the Internet that most people use, <a href="https://techlog360.com/darknet-vs-dark-web-vs-deep-web-vs-surface-web/">a small subset of the entire network</a>, has become filled with ads, trackers, <span class='complex_word'><span class='complex_word'>viruses</span></span>, spyware, and all sorts of bad actors looking to exploit naive users. Mankind managed to turn one of its greatest <span class='complex_word'>inventions</span> into a hacker&#8217;s playground, set in a cesspool of <span class='complex_word'>invasive</span> <span class='complex_word'>monetization</span> <span class='complex_word'>strategies</span>. Lucky for us, a few simple steps can do a lot to help <span class='complex_word'>mitigate</span> these problems. These tips will do little more than that, though, and I want to make that clear. I wrote this to help <span class='complex_word'>mitigate</span> the dangers of ads, trackers, <span class='complex_word'><span class='complex_word'>viruses</span></span>, spyware, and some low-level hackers, not with the intent to make your <span class='complex_word'>computer</span> <span class='complex_word'>uncrackable</span>. If a smart enough person targets a <span class='complex_word'>specific</span> machine, they will get in.</p>
<h3>The Easy Fix: Installing Software</h3>
<h4>Browser Extensions</h4>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 147. Sentences: 7</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>A few key programs can stop most web-based ads, trackers, and the types of resources that load <span class='complex_word'>viruses</span> and spyware. Many people work hard to exploit naive users, but many others also work hard to keep those bad actors from doing so; the latter create software like <a href="https://adblockplus.org/">Adblock Plus</a>, <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/">Ghostery</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock Origin</a>. Adblock Plus hides ads, which will also make <span class='complex_word'>websites</span> load faster. Ghostery stops creepy sites from tracking you around the Internet. uBlock Origin can target <span class='complex_word'>anything</span>; on the off chance that the other two miss <span class='complex_word'>something</span>, I use it to block <span class='complex_word'>individual</span> resources. Although they <span class='complex_word'>overlap</span> in some areas, I like using them all because each does a <span class='complex_word'>different</span> thing well. Installing all three takes just a few clicks, and even with their default settings, they make browsing the web much better; for even better results, spend some time learning how to fine-tune them.</p>
<h4>Antivirus Software</h4>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 122. Sentences: 6</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>After browser <span class='complex_word'>extensions</span>, <span class='complex_word'>antivirus</span> software does a great job as a second layer of defense. Windows comes with basic <span class='complex_word'>antivirus</span> software by default, but those looking to beef up their <span class='complex_word'>security</span> should check out some great free programs, too. <a href="https://www.avast.com">Avast</a> for all platforms, and <a href="https://usa.kaspersky.com">Kaspersky</a> for the PC, score high in all reviews. Although an easy attack vector, hackers do not have to go through the web browser to access your machine or your network; they may target one&#160;&#8212;&#160;or both&#160;&#8212;&#160;in ways that <span class='complex_word'>extensions</span> like Adblock Plus, Ghostery, and uBlock Origin cannot stop. Should someone get into your machine or your network, Avast, Kaspersky, and <span class='complex_word'>similar</span> tools will help detect and remove them. Installing these, too, takes just a few clicks.</p>
<h3>The Tough Fix: Altering System Behavior</h3>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 151. Sentences: 9</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>Browser <span class='complex_word'>extensions</span> can make it harder for hackers to find easy ways into a target. Antivirus software adds a second layer of <span class='complex_word'>security</span> for machines and the network. Good programs such as Avast and Kaspersky use passive measures like virus scans, and active measures like blocking <span class='complex_word'>suspicious</span> <span class='complex_word'>behavior</span>. This basis will serve the <span class='complex_word'>average</span> user well. I want to stress that it does not make them immune to all attacks, though, just the most basic ways bad actors steal <span class='complex_word'>personal</span> data, infect <span class='complex_word'><span class='complex_word'>computer</span>s</span>, and trash the web browsing <span class='complex_word'>experience</span>. Again, if a smart person targets a <span class='complex_word'>specific</span> <span class='complex_word'>computer</span>, they will get in. Those looking for better results can take some more advanced steps, though, so I talk about those below. Fair warning, I use a Unix shell and Windows Command Prompt often. It made much more sense to give you short commands than guide you through a complex maze of menus.</p>
<h4>Automatic Updates</h4>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 120. Sentences: 7</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>Automatic <span class='complex_word'>updates</span> take too long, force reboots, and seem to happen at the worst times; turning this feature off, though, makes a hacker&#8217;s job just a little bit easier. Most system <span class='complex_word'>updates</span> patch bugs and <span class='complex_word'>vulnerabilities</span> a hacker could use as a way into your machine. Do the right thing, turn them on, and let them install often. Do the same for programs from trusted vendors as well. This takes <span class='complex_word'>discipline</span>, but it will make you less <span class='complex_word'>susceptible</span> to the types of attacks found on public sites like <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/">Exploit Database</a>. Exploit Database lists hundreds of ways hackers can use old versions of software and <span class='complex_word'>operating</span> systems to get into a machine. Stay <span class='complex_word'>updated</span> and give yourself less to worry about.</p>
<h4>The hosts file</h4>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 76. Sentences: 3</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>Another simple way to make web browsing just a little bit better involves <span class='complex_word'>editing</span> your <span class='command'>host</span> file. In simple terms, <span class='complex_word'>every</span> time your <span class='complex_word'>computer</span> tries to connect to <span class='complex_word'>www.google.com</span>, it checks a system file to see whether you have <span class='complex_word'>visited</span> the website before. If you have, it loads <span class='complex_word'>information</span> about <span class='complex_word'>www.google.com</span> from your <span class='complex_word'>computer</span> and then serves the site; if not, it looks for that <span class='complex_word'>information</span> on the Internet, downloads it, and then serves the site.</p>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 74. Sentences: 5</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>Now <span class='complex_word'>imagine</span> that instead of you trying to open Google, a website tried to make a sneaky <span class='complex_word'>connection</span> to <span class='complex_word'>www.TrackMyUsers.com</span>. Your <span class='complex_word'>computer</span> first checks the <span class='command'>hosts</span> file for <span class='complex_word'>information</span> about that site, then the Internet, and then loads the page. You can use the <span class='command'>hosts</span> file to fool that sleazy site, though, by giving it the wrong <span class='complex_word'>information</span> about <span class='complex_word'>www.TrackMyUsers.com</span>. As a result, the sleazy website does not get to track you. Privacy preserved.</p>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 70. Sentences: 4</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>Bad actors use many <span class='complex_word'>websites</span> for their sleazy <span class='complex_word'>purposes</span>, but many people have gone to great pains to <span class='complex_word'>catalog</span> all those pages as well. Several people publish lists with tens of thousands of <span class='complex_word'>websites</span> like <span class='complex_word'>www.TrackMyUsers.com</span>, with the sole purpose of helping users block them. I found Dan Pollock&#8217;s <span class='complex_word'>collection</span> first at <a href="https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/">SomeoneWhoCares.org</a>. After some research, I learned that <a href="https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts">Steven Black</a> combines fourteen lists and posts <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/alternates/fakenews-gambling-porn-social/hosts">the result</a> on GitHub.</p>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 67. Sentences: 3</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>If you want to download Steven&#8217;s code, run the scripts, and set your system up on your own, go for it. On a Mac, though, you can just open Terminal, copy and paste the snippet below, hit Enter, and input your password. The snippet backs up your <span class='command'>hosts</span> file to <span class='command'>hosts.bak</span>, downloads Steven&#8217;s list, and tells your <span class='complex_word'>computer</span> to read this new <span class='command'>hosts</span> file from then on.</p>
<pre class="shell">sudo cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.bak; sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/alternates/fakenews-gambling-porn-social/hosts -o /etc/hosts; dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder</pre>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 56. Sentences: 2</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>On Windows, open Notepad, open or create the file at %C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts%, copy and paste <span class='complex_word'>everything</span> on <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/alternates/fakenews-gambling-porn-social/hosts">this page</a> into Notepad, and save it. Next, click the Start button, type <span class='command'>cmd</span>, right-click Command Prompt and choose &#8220;Run as Administrator&#8221;, then run the command below to tell your <span class='complex_word'>computer</span> to read this new hosts file from now on.</p>
<pre class="cmd">ipconfig /flushdns</pre>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 80. Sentences: 5</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>Any time a website tries to connect to a known bad domain, it will fail. This alone will remove a lot of ads, trackers, and even some known sources of <span class='complex_word'>viruses</span> and spyware. Although Adblock Plus, Ghostery, and uBlock Origin also do this, blocking those <span class='complex_word'>websites</span> at the system level with your <span class='command'>hosts</span> file means those <span class='complex_word'>extensions</span> won&#8217;t have to work as hard. Because they do less, your browser does less, which can improve browsing speeds. A win all around.</p>
<h4>Virtual Private Networks</h4>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 111. Sentences: 5</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 1; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>I also suggest using a Virtual Private Network, or VPN. Although many <span class='complex_word'>websites</span> have gotten much better about <span class='complex_word'>encrypting</span> their traffic, bad actors can still manage to steal <span class='repeat private'>private</span> <span class='complex_word'>information</span> from anyone on a public WiFi network. VPNs connect you to a safe server, encrypt your data so no one can snoop on you, and then send your traffic out from that safe server to the world. Although this adds a few extra steps to the process, and will set you back a few dollars per month, it makes stealing your <span class='repeat private'>private</span> <span class='complex_word'>information</span> and tracking you much harder. Most VPNs also block ads, meaning you will see even less of them.</p>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 57. Sentences: 4</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>Choose a <span class='complex_word'>reputable</span> <span class='complex_word'>company</span> and you cannot go wrong. <a href="https://nordvpn.com/">NordVPN</a> stands out as one of the best, though, so check it out. NordVPN has clients for the major <span class='complex_word'>operating</span> systems, browsers, and phones, so it can protect you <span class='complex_word'>everywhere</span>. Follow its simple setup guide and even novice users will have a working VPN setup in no time.</p>
<h4>The Router</h4>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 63. Sentences: 4</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>With browser <span class='complex_word'>extensions</span>, <span class='complex_word'>antivirus</span> software, and a VPN on your machine, hackers will have a much harder time gaining access to your system. Each one of these blocks <span class='complex_word'>several</span> avenues of attack, but not <span class='complex_word'>every</span> one. Again, if a smart person targets a <span class='complex_word'>specific</span> <span class='complex_word'>computer</span>, they will get in. Another great way to make that much harder, though, involves locking down your router.</p>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 57. Sentences: 5</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>Most people use the cable <span class='complex_word'>company&#8217;s</span> router. It sits on a shelf, and when the Internet stops working, they unplug it, wait a few seconds, then plug it back in. Problem solved. Few <span class='complex_word'>understand</span> how these devices work, though, and so most people gloss over them when beefing up their <span class='complex_word'>security</span>. Do not make the same mistake.</p>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 66. Sentences: 4</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>All traffic from the home network out to the <span class='complex_word'>internet</span>, and from the <span class='complex_word'>internet</span> into any device on the home network, goes through the router. Anyone trying to hack into one of your <span class='complex_word'>computers</span> has to go through this device. This makes the router your first line of defense against the outside world. Lucky for us, locking it down does not take a lot of work.</p>
<h5>Locating the Router</h5>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 49. Sentences: 4</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>You must login to your router to change its settings. If you have never done this before, you need to find it on your network. On a Mac, use <span class='command'>netstat</span>. The <span class='command'>grep</span>, <span class='command'>head</span>, and <span class='command'>awk</span> commands after it strip out the things you do not need for this step.</p>
<pre class="shell">netstat -nr | grep default | head -1 | awk -F " " '{print "Router IP: ",$2}'</pre>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 19. Sentences: 2</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>On a Windows machine, use %<span class='complex_word'>ipconfig</span><span class='command'>. </span>findstr% pulls out the line with the IP address for the default <span class='complex_word'>gateway</span>.</p>
<pre class="cmd">ipconfig /all | findstr "Default Gateway"</pre>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 77. Sentences: 6</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>Once you have the router&#8217;s IP address, copy and paste it into your browser. A login window will open. If you have seen this page before, enter your <span class='complex_word'>credentials</span>; if not, try the defaults for your cable <span class='complex_word'>company</span>. Using &#8220;admin&#8221; as your <span class='complex_word'>username</span> and &#8220;admin&#8221;, &#8220;password&#8221;, or leaving the password field blank works most times. You could also try searching for the defaults for your router. Once you have logged in, move on to the next step.</p>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 35. Sentences: 2</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>From here on out, the route you take to change each setting will vary between devices. I will explain what you should change and why, and leave it up to you to get it done.</p>
<h5>Login Credentials</h5>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 68. Sentences: 3</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>First, change your login <span class='complex_word'>credentials</span>. Anyone who can find the IP address of your router, a public-facing device, can access it just as you did; once there, a bad actor could do all sorts of things to steal your <span class='complex_word'>personal</span> <span class='complex_word'>information</span>, attack the machines on your home network, and watch <span class='complex_word'>every</span> single thing you do on the Internet. Choose a good password, save your changes, and move on.</p>
<h5>Firmware Updates</h5>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 66. Sentences: 4</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>Next, update your router&#8217;s firmware. If you can turn on <span class='complex_word'>automatic</span> <span class='complex_word'>updates</span>, do it. Again, most system <span class='complex_word'>updates</span> patch bugs and <span class='complex_word'>vulnerabilities</span> a hacker could use as a way into your machine, so turning them on will make you less <span class='complex_word'>susceptible</span> to the types of attacks found on public sites like <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/">Exploit Database</a>. At the least, update your firmware now and plan on doing this often.</p>
<h5>Disable WPS</h5>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 59. Sentences: 4</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>If your router has it, turn off WiFi Protected Setup. Although a nice idea, in practice WPS allows bad actors to bypass the router. By guessing a short PIN number, they gain access to the network without having to enter the much longer WiFi password. Leave this feature on and you risk someone <span class='complex_word'>sidestepping</span> your first line of defense.</p>
<h5>Use WPA2</h5>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 53. Sentences: 4</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>Routers can use a few kinds of <span class='complex_word'>encryption</span>. WEP takes almost no time to crack; avoid it at all costs. WPA does a better job, but you should also avoid it. Some routers support WPA2 and AES <span class='complex_word'>encryption</span>, so choose that if you can; if not, <span class='complex_word'>vanilla</span> WPA2 will keep your data safe.</p>
<h5>Use a Firewall</h5>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 59. Sentences: 3</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>Some routers ship with their <span class='complex_word'>firewall</span> turned off by default. Make sure yours has it on, and set it to the strictest level you can without making your network <span class='complex_word'>useless</span>. Most people can handle a medium-level filter without any problems, but the stricter you go, the better; in turn, bad actors will have fewer ways to exploit your network.</p>
<h5>Schedule Uptime</h5>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 82. Sentences: 5</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>Not all routers support this, but if yours does, set it to turn your network off during certain times of the day. Hackers tend to target <span class='complex_word'>businesses</span> at night, with no one around, and home networks at night or during normal business hours, when most people work. This helps them stay <span class='complex_word'>unnoticed</span>. They might also choose these times to move lots of data, because you would not notice a drop in speed. Deny them the chance by shutting down <span class='complex_word'>whenever</span> you can.</p>
<h5><span class='replace'> Enable </span> MAC Address Filtering</h5>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 36. Sentences: 3</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>Every Internet-connected device has a unique <span class='complex_word'>identifier</span> burned into its hardware, called a MAC address. It looks like this: <span class='command'>aa:b1:2c:d3:e4:5f</span>. Turn on MAC address <span class='complex_word'>filtering</span> to allow certain devices onto your network, and deny all others.</p>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 44. Sentences: 2</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>On a Unix machine, use the first snippet to find your MAC address; on a Windows <span class='complex_word'>computer</span>, use the second. Once found, enter the MAC address on your router, make sure you will <strong>allow</strong> this machine rather than <strong>deny</strong> it, and save the change.</p>
<pre class="shell">ifconfig | grep ether | head -1 | awk -F " " '{print "MAC address: ",$2}'</pre>
<pre class="cmd">ipconfig /all | findstr "Physical"</pre>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 38. Sentences: 2</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>Repeat this process for each device you wish to allow on your network. Although not a 100% guarantee that a bad actor cannot get onto your network, they will at least have one more barrier in their way.</p>
<h3>The Hard Fix: Changing Your Behavior</h3>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 84. Sentences: 4</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>You have locked down your browser, <span class='complex_word'>operating</span> system, and network. These steps have made getting into your machine much harder, snooping on you almost <span class='complex_word'>impossible</span>, and even gotten rid of those pesky ads and <span class='complex_word'>invasive</span> trackers as an added bonus. Thanks to your efforts, though, the most <span class='complex_word'>promising</span> attack vector has now become you. Humans almost always make for the best targets, and now that you have locked down most other avenues of approach, the hacker&#8217;s best chance of success lies in <span class='complex_word'>targeting</span> you.</p>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 121. Sentences: 5</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>Avoiding social <span class='complex_word'>engineering</span> and phishing attacks, the type that target people to gain access to a system, comes down to three things: <span class='complex_word'>awareness</span>, <span class='complex_word'>skepticism</span>, and conduct. Learn how to spot ads in search results and sham <span class='complex_word'>websites</span> trying to pass themselves off as <span class='complex_word'>legitimate</span> ones. Distrust by default email <span class='complex_word'>attachments</span> and <span class='complex_word'>anything</span> that asks for <span class='complex_word'>personal</span> <span class='complex_word'>information</span>. Avoid <span class='complex_word'>installing</span> <span class='complex_word'>anything</span> you do not need, even if it comes from a trusted source: it would not take a lot of work for a smart hacker to hijack the Microsoft Office <span class='complex_word'>installer</span>, for <span class='complex_word'>example</span>, mid-download, and replace it with a version that infects your machine with a virus of some sort. This type of man in the middle attack happens all the time.</p>
<div class='floating_stats'><div>Words: 90. Sentences: 4</div><div>Overused phrase: 0</div><div>Repeated: 0; Avoid: 0</div></div>

<p>You may have had a tough time with some of the <span class='complex_word'>technical</span> tasks here, but changing your <span class='complex_word'>behavior</span> will take the most work. There exists a gulf in <span class='complex_word'>difficulty</span> between a <span class='complex_word'>complicated</span> task like locking down a router, and a hard one like learning <span class='complex_word'>situational</span> <span class='complex_word'>awareness</span>, training <span class='complex_word'>skepticism</span>, and <span class='complex_word'>altering</span> your conduct. Work at it, though, and you will deny bad actors one of the most <span class='complex_word'>successful</span> attack vectors of all. Along with the <span class='complex_word'>technical</span> changes I outlined in the earlier sections,  these changes make you a much harder target.</p>
